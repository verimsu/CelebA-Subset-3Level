# CelebA-Subset-3Level

A 999-person subset of CelebA were labelled in 3-levels, for 3 relative attributes (attractive, big nose and smile). The levels are Strong (2), Medium (1) and None/Weak (0) indicating the level of the attribute/expression in the photo.

The data can be used in relative attribute problem where (999x998/2) pairs of SIMILAR or ORDERED photos can be obtained in total. However, the labelling is subjective; hence we suggest to use the pairs (2 vs 0) for a meaningful relative attributes dataset.

The labelling was done by 3 undergraduates at Sabanci University who worked on the relative attributes project.
